  These statistics represent recent non-CDN requests to {{config.devDomain}}.
</p>

<p>
  Requests are sorted in descending order by <a href="https://medium.com/p/9a61872c61cd">naughtiness</a>, which is a score derived from the number of requests, rate of requests, and bandwidth consumed by those requests. Hover over a request to see a tooltip containing its naughtiness score. A request's score will be reset once it isn't seen for 30 minutes.
</p>

<p>
  Rows highlighted in yellow indicate requests that are being throttled. An orange highlight indicates a blacklisted request, and a red highlight indicates that requested CSS or JS files will display an error message to the users of the requesting site due to excessive naughtiness.
